# UCI_heart_disease
Heart disease prediction can be done on the basis of conveniently obtainable health attributes such as chest pain, fasting blood sugar, resting blood pressure etc. For this project kaggleâ€™s Heart disease UCI dataset was utilized, which comes with data for 13 such attributes and ground truth labels for occurrence/ non-occurrence of heart disease. PCA was applied to remove linear dependencies between features and top 9 principal components were utilised to train Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression classifiers, where top 2 results obtained were from Logistic Regression with 89.13% accuracy and Naive Bayes with 84.78% accuracy.
